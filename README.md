# hello_world
Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

My name is Steven Simmons. I used to code, then I didn't, now I do again. It's more fun the second time around.

I'm currently studying Full-stack Dev, using Python and React JS through Bottega.
